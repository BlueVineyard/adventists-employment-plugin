# Active Context: Adventists Employment Plugin

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on understanding and documenting the organization logo functionality within the job listing system. This involves examining how employer logos are:
1. Stored in the system
2. Retrieved and displayed in forms
3. Associated with job listings
4. Managed through the user interface

## Recent Changes
No recent changes have been documented yet. This is the initial documentation of the existing system.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Logo Management System
- The organization logo is stored as an Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) field in the employer profile
- When creating a job listing, employers select their organization from a dropdown
- The system automatically retrieves and displays the associated logo
- The logo is stored both as post meta and as the featured image for the job listing

### Implementation Details
- The logo retrieval is handled via AJAX in the job form
- The `fetch_employer_details` method in the JobListingForm class retrieves:
  - Company logo (as an attachment ID)
  - Company name
  - Company website
- The JavaScript updates the form with these details in real-time
- On form submission, the logo is saved with the job listing

## Next Steps
1. **Documentation Completion**: Finish setting up the memory bank with all required files
2. **System Analysis**: Further analyze other components of the plugin to understand their functionality
3. **Potential Enhancements**: Consider improvements to the logo management system:
   - Image optimization for logos
   - Default logo fallback
   - Logo size standardization
   - Preview capabilities in the form

## Open Questions
1. Are there any performance concerns with the current logo retrieval system?
2. Is there a need for logo validation (size, dimensions, file type)?
3. How are logos displayed in the frontend job listings?
4. Is there a need for multiple logo formats for different display contexts?
