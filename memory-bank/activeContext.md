# Active Context: Adventists Employment Plugin

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on comprehensive documentation of the plugin's functionality and components. This includes:
1. Understanding the complete job listing and resume submission systems
2. Documenting the blog filtering and content display features
3. Analyzing user authentication and role-based access
4. Mapping the relationships between different components

## Recent Changes
The memory bank has been updated with a comprehensive review of all plugin components, including:

- Resume form with experience, education, and skills management
- Blog filtering and content display features
- User authentication and role management
- Fixed ACF Google Maps field rendering issue in the job form by properly formatting and saving the address and coordinates data

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Component Integration
- The plugin uses a modular architecture with separate classes for each major feature
- All components are registered in the main plugin file and initialized on WordPress hooks
- Shortcodes provide the primary interface for displaying components on the frontend
- AJAX is used extensively for form submissions and dynamic content loading

### Form Systems
- Job form includes comprehensive fields for job details, criteria, and company information
- Resume form provides a complete candidate profile with experience, education, and skills
- Both systems use AJAX for submission and provide draft/publish functionality
- Google Maps integration for location selection in the job form

### Content Management
- Blog filtering provides category-based filtering with AJAX pagination
- Related posts functionality shows content based on categories or company name
- Top blogs component displays featured content

## Next Steps
1. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Review and enhance mobile responsiveness across all components
2. **Form Validation**: Implement additional client-side validation for forms
3. **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and optimize AJAX requests and database queries
4. **User Experience Improvements**: Consider enhancements to the navigation and user flow

## Open Questions
1. How can the plugin's performance be optimized for sites with many job listings?
2. Are there opportunities to improve the integration between job listings and resumes?
3. Could the blog filtering functionality be extended to include additional criteria?
4. What analytics or reporting features might be valuable additions to the plugin?
