# Cline Rules for Adventists Employment Plugin

## Project Patterns

### Code Organization
- PHP classes follow the naming convention `class-{feature-name}.php`
- Each feature has its own CSS file named `{feature-name}.css`
- Each feature has its own JS file named `{feature-name}.js`
- Templates follow the naming convention `{feature-name}-template.php`

### WordPress Integration
- Features are implemented as classes that register shortcodes
- Each class is instantiated in the main plugin file
- WordPress hooks are used for initialization and event handling
- Custom post types are used for storing structured data

### Form Handling
- Forms are submitted via AJAX to prevent page reloads
- Nonces are used for security validation
- Form data is sanitized before storage
- JSON responses provide feedback to the user

### Logo Management
- Organization logos are stored as ACF fields in employer profiles
- Logos are retrieved via AJAX when an employer is selected
- Logos are stored both as post meta and featured images
- The employer dropdown triggers logo and company info retrieval

## User Preferences

### Documentation
- Document all key functionality in the memory bank
- Use mermaid diagrams to visualize system flows
- Keep track of both working features and planned enhancements
- Document the relationships between components
